            <h1>Mariberry Acquaintance Party</h1>
            <p>It was just a typical day for me, as it wasn’t my first time attending this kind of event. </p>
            <p>The dormitory was buzzing with excitement. Dormers were laughing, chatting, and enjoying the various games and performances lined up for the event. It felt like a typical gathering—fun, lively, and filled with the usual chatter of strangers becoming friends.</p>
