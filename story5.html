            <h1>Mariberry Acquaintance Party</h1>
            <p>As we danced, I felt like the wind is suddenly shifted, as if an angel had appeared, bringing light into my life.</p>
            <p>I was captivated by your eyes.</p>
            <p>I felt like there are butterflies in my stomach when you asked if I could place my hands on your shoulders instead of your waist.</p>
            <p>At that time, I can't hold my smile.</p>
